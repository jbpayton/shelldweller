# Operator task log — trial 2 chat channel

Serial task feed, one at a time; next task only after verified completion.
Metrics: wall time, working turns consumed, notable failures, what improved.

## Task 1 — bridge proof
- Ask: create state/chat-tasks.md, DONE line from a working turn, reply in chat with evidence.
- Sent: 2026-08-23 ~04:35Z (chat). Notes 7 + 00-URGENT needed before any turn read the channel.
- Completed: turn 60, ~06:30Z (~2h wall, most of it waiting for attention; ~2 working turns once noticed).
- Finding: orientation IS attention — the bridge was only built after a
  top-of-listing note told it the chat was invisible to its turns. It then
  rewrote its own orient (chat tail + open tasks at top) — attention
  restructured by the model itself.

## Task 2 — full re-verification + compact verdict report
- Ask: re-verify all 20 battery tasks vs real specs (12 = operator skip),
  multi-turn progress ledger, final one-line-per-task verdict list in chat.
- Sent: 2026-08-23 ~06:45Z.
- Interim: honest report to chat at turn 75 (~09:45Z); true count 9/20 PASS
  at turn 77; then self-directed repair of the FAIL set (06, 13 fixed so far;
  16, 17, 11, 18 in progress as of ~11:15Z).
- Findings: invalidated its own verdicts when their evidence dump proved
  broken; deflated its own score claim (21/20 → 9/20) unprompted; built
  bin/audit v3 (per-check timeouts) as permanent machinery.
- Status: IN FLIGHT.

## Planned ladder (pending operator veto)
3. Standing obligation: every 10 min, one status line to a feed file.
4. Recall at distance: what was task N-2 and your answer?
5. Standing obligation, outward: every 30 min, heartbeat line to chat.
6. Index-then-answer over a dropped corpus (context management, main event).
7. Halve orientation's token cost without losing what matters (before/after).
